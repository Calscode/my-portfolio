        <h2>This is the home page of my personal site, let me show you a bit about me! üöÄüåç </h2>

        <p>Firstly, thank you for visiting my page. I thought this would be a relevant way to introduce myself given the nature of the skillset I am aiming to showcase. <br/>
        This website has been build with JavaScript, React, Node, Axios, Tailwind, SQL, Postgres, Render and Supabase. To present my projects I used a back end database with my projects in a projects table and an API via axios to fetch the data from the table. <br/>
        I attempted to use tsparticles to create the background however due to clashes with WSL it presented too big of a challenge so I settled for a JS equivalent that was easier to work with for WSL, this was particles.js and was made into ints own react component.  <br/><br/>
        
        As there was no github api to pull the calendar directly I used a react-github-calendar installation alongside my username in a react component to pull my contributions onto my website. These are updated on my site every 24 hours.


        <br/><br/>
        Since stepping into the tech space from a recruitment perspective I quickly became fascinated with the possiblities from a technical perspective, so several years later and here I am.. <br/>

        One Udemy course to kickstart everything and then studying with Northcoders to top it all off ! üçí <br/>
        <br/>

        Anyway, please find below my github contributions (many more to come) and below that a summary of key events:
