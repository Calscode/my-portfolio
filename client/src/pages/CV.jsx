<h3>Software Development Graduate - Northcoders</h3>
<h4>03/2025 - 06/2025</h4>

<p>
  An immersive, <strong>high-intensity, full-stack software engineering bootcamp</strong> designed to replicate the pace and demands of a real-world tech
 environment. The core stack is <strong>JavaScript, React, and Node.js,</strong> supported by surrounding tools, databases and frameworks like Express, PostgreSQL, and
 various libraries (e.g., Jest, Supertest, Axios).
 The program places a heavy emphasis not only on coding proficiency, but also on foundational computer science principles. Iʼve developed a
 strong grasp of concepts such as <strong>scope, closures, asynchronous programming, functional programming, and object-oriented design patterns</strong>
 — all essential for writing clean, scalable code.
 This bootcamp is structured around <strong>industry best practices</strong>, including:
 <ul>
  <li><strong>Test-Driven Development (TDD)</strong> to ensure robustness and confidence in my code</li>
 <li><strong>Agile methodologies</strong>, with daily stand-ups, retrospectives, and sprint planning.</li>
 <li><strong>Collaborative workflows</strong>, including pair programming, mobbing, and code reviews, which mirror how real engineering teams function.</li>
 <li>Experience <strong>reading and implementing directly from technical documentation</strong>, as well as spiking and wireframing solutions in cross
functional teams.</li>
 <li>Working under tight deadlines, managing Git/GitHub branches, pull requests, and solving merge conflicts.</li></ul></p>
