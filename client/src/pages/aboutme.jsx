  <h2>Personal 'Blurb'</h2>
  <p>A naturally curious, ambitous and driven guy who is arguably more of a jack of all trades than a master of any specific one (at this point, working on changing this a bit). I am tech savvy, I love to try new experiences in the professional domain as well as personal and I enjoy working with both teams or solo on tasks. <br/>
  </p>
  <h2>Fun facts</h2>
  <p>- I lived in France in my earlier 20s</p>
  <p>- I have lived in several areas of London as well as several areas of Yorkshire</p>
  <p>- I recently have taken up gardening and caring for local ducks, namely one I have called Pascal and its definitely nepotism</p>
  <p>- I have been to 14 countries, 6% of the world. Aiming for more soon!</p>
